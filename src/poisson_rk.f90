! ***   POISSON   ***
! *******************

! This subroutine solves the Poisson equation
! for the self-gravitating case:
!
! Laplacian (pot)  =  4 pi rho
!
! with pot the gravitational field and rho the mass
! density.  Once we have pot, the gravitational
! force is calculated as:
!
! force = - grad (pot)
!
! In spherical symmetry the above equations reduce to:
!
!  2
! d pot  +  (2/r) d pot  =  4 pi rho
!  r               r
!
! force  =  - d pot /dr

! Solve equation using second order Runge-Kutta.

! First calculate the density
  call avg_density


! Note 1: The first point must be treated differently
! since we have a division by zero at the origin.
! If we take  dev_pot~a*r  for r<<1, with "a" constant,
! one can show that a=(4/3)*pi*rho(r=0)
! (but notice that this is only second order).

! Note 2: Remember that in order to apply correctly
! the boundaty conditions, we have two ghost points
! to the left of the origin, so the first point with
! positive r is i=1.

! First point with positive r (i=1).

     spot = dev_pot(i-1)
     sdev_pot = - 2.d0*dev_pot(i-1)/r(i-1) + 4.d0*pi*avg_rho(i-1)

!    Advance half a step.

     poth = pot(i-1) + 0.5d0*dr*spot
     dev_poth = dev_pot(i-1) + 0.5d0*dr*sdev_pot

!    Calculate sources at intermediate point.

     spot = dev_poth
     sdev_pot = - 4.d0*dev_poth/(r(i-1) + r(i)) &
          + 2.d0*pi*(avg_rho(i-1) + avg_rho(i))

  pot(-1) = pot(2)
  pot( 0) = pot(1)

  dev_pot(-1) = - dev_pot(2)
  dev_pot( 0) = - dev_pot(1)

! Calculate the force.

  force = - dev_pot

! We now need to substract a constant to the solution
! to make sure that far away the potential behaves as
! pot ~ 1/r.  This condition implies that we should
! have pot + r*dev_pot = 0 far away.  But we won't since
! we arbitrarily fixed pot(r=0)=0 above. So now we
! find the value of pot + r*dev_pot at the outer boundary
! and just substract it from the whole solution.

  pot = pot - (pot(Nr) - force(Nr)*r(Nr))
